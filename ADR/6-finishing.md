## Finishing

### Context

End of assignment

### Decision

In the assigment I could show some of my thinking. Because time was running out quickly I did took some shortcuts I would not take otherwise.

The express server is not tested.

There is no e2e test. For this I prefer to use playwright. It actually runs in the browser. For this I would create a flow from start to end.

The Data utils is overly complex. Normally I would decide to refactor this because this is code hard to maintain.

The report page is not shown, because time was running out.
For this I would create a new feature and introduce some sort of statemanagement.
The statemanagement would be interacted with in the Validatorpage and the "reportingpage".
Doing so I would not allow any direct relation between the two features.

### Consequences
